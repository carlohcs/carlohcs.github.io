<h3>Team Canvas</h3>
<p>Is a process used to provide an alignment and to put all members from a team in the same page. All team start information is consolidated with this process. Was create by Alex Ivanov and Mitya Voloshchuk. It promoves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onboarding of newsiest people on the&nbsp;team;</li>
<li>Team’s alignment;</li>
<li>Start of a&nbsp;project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PAY ATTENTION!</h4>
<p><strong>The all process can be achieved by an application of a dynamic with all members — except managers — from the team and the documentation of it. It’s important to reserve one day from the team to&nbsp;make.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All topics that will be asked needs to be write to be part of the documentation. Because of that, it's necessary to have at least 2 persons to apply the dynamic. One is responsible for to present and interaction between the participants. The another is responsible for the documentation and to&nbsp;agenda.</strong></p>
<p>Some topics as Personal goals, Common goals, Values, Strengths, Weaknesses can be used post-its to complete. Ask the questions and leave the persons think about 2 or 3 minutes and ask for them to write in the post-its and share the information with the&nbsp;members.</p>
<p><strong>Make </strong><a href="http://theteamcanvas.com/"><strong>download of the Team Canvas</strong></a> and start the dynamic&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>The day/dynamic can be divided as&nbsp;below:</p>

<h3>1. People and&nbsp;roles</h3>
<p>In the start of the dynamic, it’s necessary to understand who are the participants and know them more profoundly. So, everyone should answer these&nbsp;topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your&nbsp;name?</li>
<li>What is your nickname/How you are&nbsp;called?</li>
<li>What is your rules in the&nbsp;team?</li>
<li>Tell a curiosity about&nbsp;you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Personal&nbsp;goals</h3>
<p>Everyone has personal goals in their life around the work. It’s important to all members from the team understand what are these goals. Sometimes, a designer wants to be recognized by a beautiful and useful site. In other hand, developer wants to have more time to be better technically. So, once they now about their personal goals, they can discuss where each one will&nbsp;yield.</p>

<p>After show the before topics, it's necessary ask to the&nbsp;members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why we are doing this and all our work in the first&nbsp;place?</li>
<li>What we considered most important in common and that pushes&nbsp;us?</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, is necessary to divide the members of the team in smaller groups. Each one has to create proposes to in the final, all groups create just one propose —with maximum of 20&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<h3>8. Team's compromises</h3>
<p>All rules needs to be clear to the members. Because of this, it's necessary topics as&nbsp;below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the main rules that we want to have and to keep in our&nbsp;team?</li>
<li>What are the channels of communication?</li>
<li>We are going to celebrate our achievements?</li>
<li>We are going to metrify our progress?</li>
<li>We will have feedback?</li>
<li>It's necessary to tell anything else more to the members of the&nbsp;team?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Examples:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>Daily hour / Weekly / Intersection time /&nbsp;etc.</blockquote>
<h3>9. I Like / I&nbsp;Wish</h3>
<p>Coming to the end of the dynamic, it's interesting to ask what the people are leaving behind and forward to they work life based in the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>While people talk, someone write down what they liked (I Like column) and what they wanted to be different (I Wish&nbsp;column).</p>
<p>It's important to really take serious the I Wish column, because this column give to us what needs to be improve in a next&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>After the dynamic be applied, it's necessary to write a final document with all informations that came out and delivery it to the&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>With the document, the team is responsible to take the next steps to improve&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I had applied this dynamic a lot of times, and the results are visible. We can understand the "good members" and the member that need more pay attention. We can understand too, what will be the work way of the members and their relationships. <strong>Based with this data, we can start a </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@carlohcs/the-importance-of-team-building-for-it-team-development-case-study-8e3e20092778"><strong>Team Building</strong></a><strong> process and really make a difference in the engagement of&nbsp;team.</strong></p>
